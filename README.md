### tabsender

need to send a bunch of links to your phone?

I made this in about an hour: https://unli.xyz/tabsender/

you would use this in conjunction with something like Firefox Sync in situations where you want to send 20+ tabs or something

good for going through 50 links or so while you are at a cafe

together, we will eventually read all of the links in our 5,000-long tabs.txt
